# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is MoisÃ©s Carniel and my nickname is Quitandir

### About me

After years of working as an English teacher, I decided to make a change in my career. Initially, I started studying product management based on the suggestion of some friends. However, I soon realized that the professional transformation I sought required experience with development. In 2022, I began studying at Alura Escola de Tecnologia, and that marked the beginning of my journey. Even though I had always been interested in technology, and the connection with the English language made it easier for me, I didn't know anything about computer science. These months since I started taking development courses, learning computer languages and how to use them to make things work, have been a wonderful experience.

### Some technologies that I'm studying are:
